# Calendar-Application

## Description
The files contain the everything you need to deploy a functional day planner website that also changes colors depending of the time. Users will be able to edit and save their daily schedule within the certain time block. Many can use this to track what they have planned for the day and the data will save within the local storage.

## Experiance
In my own honest opinon, I constructed this daily planner from scratch and it seems like deveopling the html and the css is getting easier. first time using a third party api from moment in order to show the date. This ultimately help me develope a function that would allow the color to change based on when you schedule an item on your planner.
